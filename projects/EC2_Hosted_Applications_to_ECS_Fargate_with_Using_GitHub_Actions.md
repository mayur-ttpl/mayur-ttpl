## Overview

This project involves migrating applications hosted on EC2 instances to ECS Fargate to enhance high availability and scalability. The project includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, hosting the UI on CloudFront with S3, and implementing path-based routing for six microservices.

## Objectives

- Migrate EC2-hosted applications to ECS Fargate
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Host the UI on CloudFront with S3
- Implement path-based routing for microservices
- Ensure high availability and scalability of the application

## Steps and Implementation

### 1. Planning the Migration

A comprehensive migration plan was developed, including resource allocation, risk assessment, timeline, and rollback strategies to ensure a smooth transition.

### 2. Setting Up ECS Fargate

ECS Fargate was configured to run the six microservices, taking advantage of its serverless compute engine to manage containerized applications without needing to manage servers.

**Steps:**
- Create ECS Fargate clusters.
- Define task definitions for each microservice.
- Deploy microservices to the ECS Fargate clusters.

### 3. Configuring CI/CD Pipelines Using GitHub Actions

CI/CD pipelines were set up using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

**Steps:**
- Create GitHub Actions workflows for building and testing Docker images.
- Set up workflows for deploying images to ECS Fargate.
- Configure GitHub Secrets for secure handling of AWS credentials.

### 4. Hosting UI on CloudFront with S3

The UI was hosted on CloudFront with S3 to ensure fast, secure, and scalable delivery of static content.

**Steps:**
- Upload UI assets to an S3 bucket.
- Configure CloudFront distribution to serve content from the S3 bucket.
- Set up appropriate caching and invalidation rules.

### 5. Implementing Path-Based Routing for Microservices

Path-based routing was set up to route traffic to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path, ensuring that each microservice can be accessed correctly.

**Steps:**
- Configure Application Load Balancer (ALB) with path-based routing rules.
- Define target groups for each microservice.
- Test the routing to ensure correct traffic flow.

### 6. Ensuring High Availability and Scalability

ECS Fargate and CloudFront were configured to ensure high availability and scalability of the application, with automatic scaling based on traffic and load.

**Steps:**
- Set up auto-scaling policies for ECS Fargate tasks.
- Configure CloudFront for high availability with multiple edge locations.
- Test the scalability and failover mechanisms.

### 7. Testing the Migration

The entire setup was thoroughly tested to ensure that all microservices function correctly, the UI is served as expected, and the CI/CD pipeline operates seamlessly.

**Steps:**
- Perform integration and functional testing of all microservices.
- Test UI delivery from CloudFront.
- Validate the CI/CD pipeline with test deployments.

### 8. Updating the Development and Production Environments

The development environment was updated to use the new ECS Fargate setup. After successful validation, the production environment was similarly updated.

**Steps:**
- Migrate the development environment to ECS Fargate.
- Conduct final testing in the development environment.
- Migrate the production environment to ECS Fargate.
- Ensure all configurations are mirrored in production.

## Conclusion

Migrating the EC2-hosted applications to ECS Fargate, combined with setting up CI/CD using GitHub Actions, significantly improved the application's availability, scalability, and manageability. Hosting the UI on CloudFront with S3 and implementing path-based routing for microservices further enhanced the overall performance and user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement monitoring and alerting for ECS Fargate tasks and CloudFront distributions.
- Optimize CI/CD pipelines for faster deployments.
- Explore additional AWS services to further enhance application performance and security.
