## Overview

This case study outlines the process of deploying a Python Scrapy application on an EC2 server using an AWS DevOps pipeline. The deployment leverages Dockerization for container management, migrates MongoDB from on-premises to EC2, sets up a private network for security, configures auto-scaling groups behind a load balancer, and updates the AMI for the auto-scaling group with new container launches using Python and Bash scripts.

## Objectives

- Deploy Python Scrapy on an EC2 server
- Migrate MongoDB from on-premises to EC2
- Establish a private network for secure communication
- Set up an EC2 auto-scaling group behind a load balancer
- Automate AMI updates for the auto-scaling group with new container launches

## Steps and Implementation

### 1. Deployment of Python Scrapy using Docker

The deployment of the Python Scrapy application involved Dockerization to ensure consistent and isolated environments. The Docker image for the Scrapy application was created and stored in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

**Steps:**
- Create a Dockerfile for the Scrapy application.
- Build the Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR.
- Define an ECS task definition to use the Docker image.

### 2. Database Migration from On-Premises to EC2 for MongoDB

The existing MongoDB database was migrated from on-premises to an EC2 instance. The EC2 instance was configured with the necessary security groups and IAM roles.

**Steps:**
- Set up a new EC2 instance for MongoDB.
- Configure security groups and IAM roles for the instance.
- Use MongoDB tools to export data from the on-premises database and import it into the EC2 instance.

### 3. Private Network Setup

To enhance security, both the Scrapy application and MongoDB were set up in a private network within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). This ensured that the instances were not directly accessible from the internet.

**Steps:**
- Create a new VPC with subnets.
- Launch EC2 instances in the private subnets.
- Configure route tables and security groups to allow internal communication.

### 4. EC2 Auto-Scaling Group behind a Load Balancer

An auto-scaling group was set up to manage the Scrapy application instances, ensuring high availability and scalability. The auto-scaling group was placed behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic evenly.

**Steps:**
- Create a launch configuration or template for the EC2 instances.
- Set up an auto-scaling group using the launch configuration.
- Attach the auto-scaling group to an ELB.

### 5. AMI Update Automation for New Container Launches

To ensure the auto-scaling group always uses the latest container image, a mechanism was implemented to update the AMI whenever a new container is launched. This was achieved using Python and Bash scripts executed by init services on the EC2 instances.

**Steps:**
- Write a Python script to detect new container launches and create a new AMI.
- Write a Bash script to update the auto-scaling group's launch configuration with the new AMI.
- Configure the EC2 instances to run these scripts using init services.

## Conclusion

The deployment of the Python Scrapy application on an EC2 server using the AWS DevOps pipeline was successfully achieved. The process included Dockerization, database migration, private network setup, auto-scaling group configuration, and automated AMI updates. This setup ensures a scalable, resilient, and secure environment for the application, leveraging the power of AWS services.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement monitoring and logging for the Scrapy application and MongoDB.
- Optimize the auto-scaling policies based on application performance.
- Explore the use of AWS Lambda for further automation tasks.
