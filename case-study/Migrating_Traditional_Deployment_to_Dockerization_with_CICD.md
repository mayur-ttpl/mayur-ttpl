## Overview

This case study outlines the process of migrating a traditional deployment to a Dockerized environment with a CI/CD pipeline. The project involved launching new servers to avoid impacting the live development environment, configuring Dockerfiles for all microservices, migrating servers to a private network, setting up an L7 load balancer, shutting down the old development environment after testing, and replicating the setup for production using Jenkins.

## Objectives

- Migrate traditional deployment to Docker
- Launch new servers to avoid impacting the live development environment
- Configure Dockerfiles for all microservices and perform testing
- Migrate servers to a private network
- Set up an L7 load balancer for application access
- Shut down the old development environment after testing with backups
- Set up a CI/CD deployment pipeline using Jenkins
- Replicate the same environment for production

## Steps and Implementation

### 1. Launching New Servers for Application

To avoid impacting the live development environment, new servers were launched in a separate network. This isolated environment allowed for testing and validation without affecting the ongoing development work.

**Steps:**
- Provision new servers in a separate VPC.
- Ensure the new servers are isolated from the live development environment.

### 2. Configuring Dockerfiles for Microservices

Each microservice in the application was Dockerized by creating Dockerfiles. These Dockerfiles defined the environment and dependencies required for each service.

**Steps:**
- Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
- Build and test Docker images locally.
- Push Docker images to a container registry.

### 3. Migrating Servers to a Private Network

For enhanced security, the servers were migrated to a private network within a VPC, ensuring that they were not accessible from the public internet.

**Steps:**
- Create a new VPC with private subnets.
- Launch Dockerized services within the private subnets.
- Configure security groups and route tables to ensure secure communication.

### 4. Setting Up an L7 Load Balancer

An L7 load balancer was configured to route traffic to the appropriate microservices. This ensured efficient distribution of requests and improved application availability.

**Steps:**
- Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS.
- Configure target groups for each microservice.
- Define routing rules to direct traffic to the correct targets.

### 5. Shutting Down the Old Development Environment

After successfully migrating and testing the new environment, the old development environment was backed up and shut down to avoid unnecessary costs and potential conflicts.

**Steps:**
- Perform thorough testing of the new environment.
- Backup the old development environment.
- Shut down and decommission the old servers.

### 6. Setting Up a CI/CD Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins

A CI/CD pipeline was set up using Jenkins to automate the deployment process. This pipeline ensured that new changes were automatically built, tested, and deployed.

**Steps:**
- Install and configure Jenkins.
- Create Jenkins pipelines for building and deploying Docker images.
- Integrate Jenkins with the container registry and deployment targets.

### 7. Replicating the Environment for Production

The same setup was replicated for the production environment, ensuring consistency and reliability across both development and production stages.

**Steps:**
- Mirror the development setup in a production VPC.
- Apply the same security configurations and load balancer settings.
- Validate the production deployment with rigorous testing.

## Conclusion

Migrating the traditional deployment to a Dockerized environment with a CI/CD pipeline significantly improved the deployment process's efficiency, security, and scalability. The approach ensured minimal disruption to the live development environment and provided a robust framework for future deployments.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement monitoring and alerting for the Dockerized services.
- Optimize the CI/CD pipeline for faster deployments.
- Explore additional Docker features to enhance application resilience and performance.
